# üß† MNIST Digit Recognizer with PyTorch & Tkinter
Handwritten digit recognition with PyTorch, Tkinter GUI, and Grad-CAM visualizations.

## üìå Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network in **PyTorch** for classifying handwritten digits. It also includes a Tkinter-based graphical interface for real-time digit recognition, as well as performance evaluation tools and model interpretability via Grad-CAM.

Grad-CAM provides visual explanations by highlighting areas of the input image that are most influential in the model's decision-making.

## üî¢ Dataset and Sample Digits

The model is trained on the **MNIST dataset**, a well-known collection of grayscale images representing handwritten digits from 0 to 9. 

The dataset is split into three subsets:
- **Test set:** 10,000 images
- **Training set:** 54,000 images  
- **Validation set:** 6,000 images

Below is a grid of sample digits from the dataset:
